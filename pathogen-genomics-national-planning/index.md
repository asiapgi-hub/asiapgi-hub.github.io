# Workshop guide for pathogen genomics national planning

## Introduction

Following the release of the WHO Global Genomic Surveillance Strategy for Pathogens with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential in 20221, there is an interest in sustaining and expanding the genomic surveillance capacity built during the COVID-19 pandemic for public health surveillance. Genomic surveillance has been proven to enable early identification and tracking of SARS-CoV-2 variants which can inform public health actions to prevent further spread of the disease. Genomic characterization helped determine the transmission dynamics in the recent outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N1). In the case of tuberculosis, genomic sequencing can be used for early detection of additional drug-resistant associated mutations. Antimicrobial resistance, regarded as a top global health threat, will benefit from increased genomic characterization usage to inform antimicrobial stewardship and clinical decision-making. Genomic information has also accelerated the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.

However, further investments are needed to sustain and expand this capacity. A national strategic plan for pathogen genomics which includes an assessment of current genomic sequencing capacity, country-specific prioritised pathogens, a full range of genomic utility for prioritised pathogens and a detailed costing methodology to integrate pathogen genomics into existing surveillance systems and national communicable disease programmes will be crucial for sustainability and longevity.

In the Asia PGI landscape assessment (2022 – 2023)2, only 54% of countries assessed in Asia have national strategic plans for genomic surveillance, emphasizing the need for sustainable, resource-efficient strategies. Countries will require tools and guidance to inform national planning for pathogen genomics.

The content of this workshop package intends to inform a stepwise approach to developing a national strategic plan for pathogen genomics. Even though this workshop was designed for Asian countries based in their specific needs, the information and guidance may apply to other regions similarly.

## Objectives

Objectives of the workshop are:

1. Facilitate planning to apply pathogen genomics to inform meaningful public health interventions.
2. Provide training on tools and the use of a systems approach to develop efficient and sustainable public health genomics implementation strategies.
3. Outline regional and national pathogen genomics priorities, opportunities and challenges.

This workshop is not meant to develop finalised national strategic plans for genomic surveillance but instead introduce the concept, tools and frameworks to guide decision-makers into developing a national strategic plan for genomic surveillance.

## Outcome

Outcomes of the workshop are:

1. Participants to understand the importance of national strategic plans for genomic surveillance
2. Participants to understand an investment case approach for pathogen genomics
3. Participants to evaluate and prioritize country-specific pathogens for public health infectious disease genomic surveillance
4. Participants to evaluate genomic utility for prioritised pathogens and integration into multi-pathogen planning
5. Participants to understand the costing components of genomic sequencing for surveillance, as well as the supply chain dynamics and health financing strategies that impact its sustainability.

## Target audience

1. Senior government official involved in infectious disease surveillance at a national strategic level with:
   • Experience designing, planning, and implementing national infectious disease surveillance programs
   • Decision-making power or influence on pathogen genomics strategy and funding
2. Technical expert from government, academia, or another public health partner with:
   • Experience designing, planning, and implementing the laboratory components of public health surveillance systems
   • Understanding of laboratory, data analysis, and epidemiological techniques
   • Familiarity with different genomic sequencing approaches
   • Understanding of the current laboratory, data infrastructure, and surveillance capacity
   • Ability to engage with multiple entities across the national network of public health laboratories and collaborating institutions to plan and implement pathogen genomic surveillance
